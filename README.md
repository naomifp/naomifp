## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Naomi Panjaitan**.

I am a Ph.D. student in **Transportation Technology and Policy** at UC Davis

My research interest in terms of methods is **discrete choice modeling**, such as multinomial logit, nested logit, and MDCEV. 
I am looking to learn *Machine Learning* and how does it apply to transportation research.

In terms of topics, 
I am always inclined to questions around *transportation planning* (demand management) and *women's needs and challenges in transportation*. 
I am eager to better understand the interaction between people's travel behavior with extrinsic factors around them as well as intrinsic factors within them. 
Thus, I am currently working on the **Mobility of Care** -- all kinds of travel taken to pursue activities related to care, such as grocery shopping, dropping off or picking up kids, and doing errands. 
Other than that, I am attracted to public transit given my lifetime experiences as a committed public transit rider.
